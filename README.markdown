#LyTeXTools: LilyPond-aware LaTeXTools for Sublime Text 2

This package adds `lilypond-book` support to [Marciano Siniscalchiâ€™s](http://tekonomist.wordpress.com/) [LaTeXTools](http://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

The `lytextools-tmux` branch, which you are currently viewing, is custom-made for use in my own tmux-based setup. **It will most certainly not work on your system as is**, although you are welcome to explore the code. Please check out the [`lytextools` branch](https://github.com/yrammos/LyTeXTools/tree/lytextools) instead, which is the default branch on this repo. Thank you.
